Maybe the models for things like Player, Room, Commands etc will have an associated Language Model that 
allocates language words for attributes. i.e. if the Player model has "name" as an attribute, then 
the PlayerLanguage model or class will have a list of what that language calls that i.e. "name" = "ingoa".
